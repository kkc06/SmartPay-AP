# Responsible AI: SmartPay AP

---

## Slide 1: Responsible AI Principles in SmartPay AP

**1. Bias Mitigation**
- Synthetic and real datasets are regularly audited for class, vendor, and country balance.
- Model features are engineered to avoid direct use of sensitive attributes (e.g., vendor name, country) in decision logic.
- Regular fairness checks: Precision/recall metrics are monitored across key segments (vendor, region, currency).
- Human-in-the-loop approval step ensures that no automated action (e.g., payment block, dispute email) is taken without review.

**2. Data Privacy & Security**
- All invoice/PO data is processed in-memory; no raw data is stored outside secure cloud storage.
- GDPR compliance: Data minimization, right-to-erasure, and audit logging are enforced.
- Access to sensitive data and model outputs is role-based and logged.
- No vendor PII is used in LLM prompts or external API calls.

## Slide 2: Audit Trail & Model-Ops Monitoring

**1. Audit Trail**
- Every agentic workflow step (data load, match, email draft, approval) is logged with timestamp, user, and action.
- All model predictions, confidence scores, and explanations are stored for traceability.
- Dispute emails and payment triggers are only sent after explicit human approval, with full audit log.

**2. Model-Ops & Monitoring**
- Model versioning: All models are tracked with unique IDs and training metadata.
- Continuous monitoring: Precision, recall, and error rates are tracked in production.
- Drift detection: Alerts are triggered if data or prediction distributions shift significantly.
- Retraining pipeline: Supports regular updates with new labeled data and bias/fairness checks.

- All logs and monitoring are designed for compliance and transparency.
