# SmartPay AP - Accounts Payable Automation Platform

## Key Features

**Intelligent Invoice Matching**: The system uses a combination of exact matching and fuzzy logic to link invoices with purchase orders. It handles real-world scenarios like vendor name variations, currency mismatches, and missing purchase order references.

**Risk-Based Decision Making**: Rather than relying solely on model predictions, the system implements multi-factor decision logic that considers business rules, materiality thresholds, and confidence levels to determine appropriate actions.

**Automated Dispute Resolution**: When mismatches are detected, the system generates contextually appropriate emails with varying urgency levels based on the severity of discrepancies. All communications include detailed supporting information and appropriate escalation timelines.

**Governance and Compliance**: The platform implements a comprehensive governance framework with multiple layers of protection. This includes tool allowlisting to restrict agent actions, input validation with type checking and parameter validation, exception handling with detailed error context, and business logic constraints that prevent over-reliance on single model outputs. The system maintains detailed decision audit trails, implements risk-based escalation workflows, and requires mandatory human approval for all email communications and sensitive operations.

## Governance and Risk Management

### Guardrails Implementation

The system implements a defense-in-depth approach to ensure safe and compliant operation:

**Tool Access Control**: The agent can only execute pre-approved functions through a strict allowlist mechanism. Any attempt to use unauthorized tools results in immediate termination with detailed error logging.

**Input Validation**: All tool calls undergo comprehensive validation including parameter count verification, data type checking, and business rule compliance. Invalid inputs are rejected with descriptive error messages before any processing occurs.

**Exception Handling**: Robust error handling ensures graceful degradation when issues arise. All exceptions are caught, logged with full context, and converted to actionable error messages while preserving system stability.

**Multi-Factor Decision Logic**: Rather than relying solely on model predictions, the system combines ML outputs with business rules, confidence thresholds, and materiality assessments to make final decisions.

### Compliance Features

**Audit Trail**: Every decision includes comprehensive documentation of the reasoning process, confidence scores, and supporting evidence. This creates a complete audit trail for regulatory compliance and quality assurance.

**Human Approval Gates**: Critical actions such as email generation and payment holds require explicit human authorization. The system provides summary statistics and risk assessments to support decision-making.

**Status Tracking**: Clear workflow state management ensures all processes can be monitored, audited, and controlled. Each invoice maintains detailed status information throughout the reconciliation process.

**Risk-Based Escalation**: The system automatically categorizes issues by severity and routes them through appropriate escalation channels with different urgency levels and approval requirements.
